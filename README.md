# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a basic analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) data, providing insights into air quality levels based on pollutants. The script utilizes a sample dataset and includes components for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization. Explore this script to understand the fundamental steps involved in analyzing and visualizing AQI data.

## Script Components

- **Data Loading:** Loading a sample AQI dataset or replacing it with your own data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **AQI Calculation:** Calculating the AQI based on pollutant concentrations.
- **Visualization:** Plotting visualizations to represent air quality trends.
- **Output Display:** Displaying visualizations and analysis results.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`air_quality_analysis.py`) in a Python environment.
2. The script will load the sample AQI dataset (or replace it with your own) and perform data analysis.
3. Inspect the generated visualizations to understand air quality trends based on pollutants.

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own AQI data for specific analysis.
- Experiment with different visualizations or additional analysis metrics.
- Modify the script to include specific pollutant thresholds or standards relevant to your region.
